This game tries to show a lot of information about Lebanon with an ironic atmosphere. The game is meant to be a small experience and not a huge game with a replayability value mainly, but more to it with the mini games.

# Personal Message
This served as my senior project.
I've poured a lot of work and while it's in no way near being perfect, I'm incredibly proud of it.
The reason I moved it to Github and made i public is because I might able to help out fellow gamers and game developers to somehow check how to workaround something.
While this project won't be my main task anymore, I will try to keep it adding more to it to make it more reader friendly. It's already very simple,but it can use a little bit polishing around the edges... And the sides... Maybe all of it... DEFENITELY all of it.
I will personally take any help from anyone who would like to add more to it, and would love to answer anything anyone finds even a tid complicated.
I've also worked on a personal documentation that I'll upload later on with time.

# Game Notes 
Game has Lebanese theme
Collection of mini-games <=> Each minigame has a menu Scene, main Scene, winner Scene and a tutorial scene.
Adventure/Storytelling mode just allows playing the mini games once each and has a (SURPRISE) story... This is more about learning how to tell a "story".

* Programming was very easy. I've written a document of things I learned that I will share later on.
* Graphics & Animations were mostly free assets available online. (Will share my favorite website too).
* Audio is also mostly free assets BUT the intros and tutorials were my idea.

# Programming Notes
It's very simplistic.
I've done my best to organize the folders and scripts, and I'll give more time to make it more reader-friendly.

# Git Notes
This project was first worked on (until the "senior ready" branch) on Gitlab. Exporting it to Github had some side effects, mainly milestones,issues and labels not moving with it. With that said, I'll re-add my personal issues that I didn't finish soon.

Note: Any remarks on how to arrange my branches would be perfect. I'm still fairly new to all of this. 

## Branches
The game went through different stages as my learning process continued. In general, this is how my head wraps around it:
* __Master__
    This is the main branch... Hopefully no major bugs will make their here
* __Dev__
    Anything I'm personally working on and is almost ready to be dropped into the master branch.
* __Senior-Ready__
    The name should explain it. The stage at which I had this project presented as a senior. Hopefully, I'll get back to it later on and still be proud of my spaghetti code.
* __v0.1, 0.2...__
    As stages went on, and additions were, erm, ADDED. I kept pushing with every milestone I hit. I might delete those branches in the future if they prove to be tiresome to look at.

## Issues
I will hopefully add these notes in milestones, but here's a quick run on things.

# What's Next?

## Technical additions
The game is focused on multiplayer, but it's currently only local, hopefully it'll soon have webgl to be playable on a network.

## Quality of life
* Improving the quality of the game. In other words, better graphics that make the game look a bit more consistent, and the levels be insync.
* Having players add their own names.
* ...

## Game Idea Additions
* Make a different Adventure/Storyline
* Improvements on current mini games
* New mini-games
